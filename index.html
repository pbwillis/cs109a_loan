      <p>Peer-2-peer financial institutions like <strong>Lending Club</strong> are exposed to risk from loan default. When a customer defaults on a loan, Lending Club and its investors risk losing their money.</p>    
      <p>To mitigate the risk from default, Lending Club has developed a grading system to classify potential customers. They have also published data on the loans, allowing researchers to study determinants of loan default.</p>
      <p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139427"> Researchers have found </a> that Lending Club's grade and associated interest rate is highly predictive of loan default. They have also found measures of borrower indebtness to be highly predictive.</p>

      <p>Our project builds on this research, applying machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for loan defaults. Specifically, we are looking at predicting defaults among two populations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong> Lending Club’s current loans </strong> - where Lending Club has data on the individual's payment history</li>
        <li> <strong> New Lending Club customers </strong> - where Lending Club has only basic demographic and financial data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
      <a id="data-exploration" class="anchor" href="#data-exploration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data exploration</h2>

      <p>We used open data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data">Lending Club</a>, on loans issued by the platform from 2007-2015. There were <strong>887,379 loans</strong> in the dataset, and <strong>74 predictor variables</strong>. </p>

      <p>We worked to understand the loan grade assigned by Lending Club (A through to F). We found that the loan grade was highly correlated to the interest rate -- <strong> correlation coefficient of 0.9541 </strong>. This suggests that the Lending Club uses loan grade to determine interest rate to a great extent.</p>

      <p> We visualized data on the demographic nature of loan defaults. Key findings included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Individuals who defaulted on their loans had few previous delinquent accounts </li>
        <li> Individuals with all levels of work experience defaulted on their loans </li>
        <li> There were very few cases of individuals with self reported <strong> incomes greater than $50,000 </strong> defaulting on their loans </li>
      </ul>

      <a id="data-pre-processing" class="anchor" href="#data-pre-processing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data pre-processing</h2>

      <p>In preparation to create predictive models for our two populations of interest we then proceeded to clean the data:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Removed loans whose "loan status" was "Current". This left us with approximately <strong>250,000 loans</strong> in the dataset.</li>
        <li>Recoded "loan status" to a variable called "default", with loans being assigned a value of "0" (if they had/were not in default), and "1" (if they had defaulted). Defaulted loans constituted about <strong>16.6%</strong> of all loans. </li>
        <li>Removed all predictor variables which contained &gt;70% missing values.</li>
        <li>Imputed all remaining missing values with the median value of their respective predictor variable column. This approach was relatively unproblematic, as we had a high number of remaining observations in our dataset (250,000). </li>
     </ol>

     <p> We also removed the loan grade and interest rate from the data, since these are created by Lending Club and we are trying to replicate / improve on their model.</p>
     <p> For the model predicting default for new Lending Club customers, we removed all payment data - e.g. monthly installments paid - since Lending Club would not have that data on new customers.</p>
 
     <h2>
     <a id="model-fitting" class="anchor" href="#model-fitting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Model fitting</h2>

     <p>We then split the data into training and testing datasets (60% training  / 40% testing), and fit the following 5 models on the training dataset:</p>

     <ul>
       <li>Logistic regression</li>
       <li>Linear Discriminant Analysis</li>
       <li>Quadratic Discriminant Analysis</li>
       <li>Decision Trees</li>
       <li>Random Forests</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
    <a id="cross-validation" class="anchor" href="#cross-validation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cross validation</h2>

    <p>Thereafter, we performed 5-fold cross-validation on the training data for the 3 models which most accurately predicted loan defaults in the initial run:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Logistic regression (<strong>C regularization parameter</strong>)</li>
      <li>Decision Trees (<strong>depth of tree</strong>, <strong>minimum number of samples per leaf</strong>)</li>
      <li>Random Forests (<strong>number of trees</strong>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p> When performing the 5-fold cross-validation we split the training data into folds, holding out the test set. We then scored the models on the test set, to try to prevent overfitting as much as possible.</p>

    <h3> Model selection </h3>
      <p>For our first population of interest - <strong> current Lending Club customers</strong> - our optimal model after cross validation was <strong>regularized logistic regression</strong>.</p>
      <p> We conducted model selection based on the model's ability to predict class 1 (default), rather than overall accuracy.</p>

    <br>
    <p>We tuned the value of the regularization parameter of the logistic regression model, to maximize predictive accuracy on class 1. A <strong>value of 10^-2</strong> generated the best score.</p>

    <h3> Feature importance</h3>
    <p> To better understand feature importance we referred to the <strong> decision tree model </strong>. </p>
    <p> The optimal cross validated decision tree model for current Lending Club customers had a maximum depth of 10. It's prediction accuracy on class 1 was <strong> 0.9613 </strong>, slightly less than logistic regression (0.9645). </p>
    
    <p> The <strong> top three levels </strong> of the optimal decision tree model are included below. </p>
    <p> The most important features are those relating to past payment behavior - <strong> last payment amount, remaining principal, late fees, principal received, payment to investors and size of monthly installment. </strong> </p>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darlian/cs109a_loan/gh-pages/full_tree.jpeg" alt="Decision Tree_Full"></p>
    <p> The result that past payment behavior is predictive of future payment behavior is quite intuitive. What is useful about our model is that it provides lending club with information on <strong> "early warnings of default" </strong>. Lending Club could target default prevention interventions to at-risk customers identified by our model.</p>

    <h3> Model selection </h3>
      <p>For our second population of interest - <strong> new Lending Club customers </strong> - our optimal model after cross validation was also <strong>regularized logistic regression</strong>.</p>
      <p> Again, we conducted model selection based on the model's ability to predict class 1 (default), rather than overall accuracy.</p>

      </tr>      
    </table>
    <br>  
    <p>Maximum predictive accuracy on class 1 was at a <strong>value of 10^-4</strong> for the regularization parameter of the logistic regression model.</p>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darlian/cs109a_loan/gh-pages/log_reg%20restricted.png" alt="Image of CV_new"></p>

    <h3> Feature importance </h3>
    <p> For new Lending Club customers we also extracted feature importance from the decision tree model. </p>
    <p> The optimal cross validated decision tree model had a maximum depth of 2, with a prediction accuracy on class 1 of <strong> 0.6443 </strong>. Again this was slightly less than logistic regression (0.6641). </p>
    <p> The optimal decision tree model is included below. The two important features are the <strong> length of the loan </strong> and <strong> annual income of the borrower</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darlian/cs109a_loan/gh-pages/restricted_tree.jpeg" alt="Decision Tree_Restricted"></p> 
    <p> Lending Club loans can either be 36 months or 60 months. The model shows us that new customers who take a 60 month loan need more income to not be at risk of default ($60,382 vs. $49,470). Some part of this is likely explained by a positive correlation between high loan amounts and 60 month loans (correlation coefficient = 0.4071).</p>

    <a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion and Further Work</h1>
    
    <p>Variables related to <strong> past payment behaviour </strong> were the most predictive of a current borrower’s eventual default, while <strong> loan term and annual income </strong> were most important for predicting defaults among new borrowers.</p>
    <p>Overall our model for current customers was much more predictive than our model for new customers.</p>
      <p> To <strong> improve our model for new customers </strong> in the future we could do further work with the text in the data, especially the job title and user-generated loan description. However both fields have drawbacks -- the loan descriptions are missing for many loans and much of the relevant information on job titles may already be captured in the annual income variable.</p>
